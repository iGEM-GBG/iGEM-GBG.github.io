ALUMNI STORY: Being involved in iGEM was a great learning experience in many ways. Perhaps most importantly, the iGEM project was the first time that you were both given the opportunity to design your own research project, but also the responsibility to see it through. This meant that you had to learn how to plan a project from start to finish, but also to think on your feet and develop solutions to problems that present themselves along the course of the project. Moreover, working in the context of a team was a great experience, as you got to develop as researchers together and identify how to make effective use of your collective skills. Finally, iGEM also allowed me to develop my practical skills in several areas, such as wet lab experiments, computational analysis, and even web design, which allowed me to further identify my research interests. \n \n Today, I am working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers, where I do research on antibiotic resistance using bioinformatics and AI. This role allows me to both develop and conduct my own research projects in active collaboration with other members of my research group. The ability to drive research projects independently and as part of a team, which I first developed in iGEM, are, thus, highly relevant even years later.

ALUMNI YEAR: 2018
ALUMNI STORY: I was part of the Chalmers-Gothenburg iGEM team of year 2018, at the end of my third Chalmers year and beginning of my masters. It was the first time I partook in the development of a project and the first time I worked (somewhat) independently in the lab. I learned so much during those few months, both in terms of working in a research environment and of working in a team. My participation enabled me to better understand the technologies we had previously only learnt about in theory, and thereby of the possibilities of their application, which is what initially sparked my interest in a scientific career. I also met key people that have been important for my choice of career path, both though inspiration and provided opportunities, and many friends I still cherish today. \n \n For me, iGEM was the start of my scientific journey, creating an interest in pursuing the limits of synthetic biology and its application in health and disease. It is a topic that further attracted me in my masters, my PhD, and that I want to continue pursuit of going forward as well. So if you have the chance to, all I can say is join! No matter whether you find out that research is for you or not, you will experience immense growth in a short period of time, and gain memories for a lifetime.

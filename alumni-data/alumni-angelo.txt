ALUMNI STORY: Being part of iGEM gave me hands-on lab experience. I developed skills in project planning and working within a larger team. It was rewarding to see the bigger picture, beyond just the lab work. I also made new friends whom I still keep in touch with today. I currently work as a Clinical Laboratory Geneticist at Karolinska University Hospital.

ALUMNI STORY: iGEM was the first time I really understood what it meant to be a researcher. During my university studies I conducted numerous laboratory experiments, but always under strict supervision and with a clear goal of what to achieve. iGEM is different, where you have to work together with your team to create your own idea of what to achieve and how you’ll get there, and think outside the box when things don’t go as planned. What I also found interesting is that the soft skills are equally important as the research. To me, the best science is the one you can clearly communicate, and that is helpful in the society as a whole. \n \n I am currently working with drug development as a pharmacometrician within Clinical pharmacology & pharmacometrics at AstraZeneca, supporting dose selection in clinical studies. I’m doing this using data analysis and mathematical modeling, always in close collaboration with a cross-functional team. In my role I feel my research has a clear purpose that can be put into context, and I have the innovative freedom to solve any challenges along the way. If science was straightforward, it wouldn’t be any fun.

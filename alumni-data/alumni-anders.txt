ALUMNI STORY: iGEM was an amazing and exciting experience. It was an opportunity to aim high together with other driven students, to build a strong sense of community through all the challenges, and to meet new like-minded friends. I loved the freedom to brainstorm and discuss a wide range of ideas, and to develop them all the way from concept to dry-lab models and, finally, actual lab plans. \n \n iGEM was incredibly educational, both within and beyond the field of biotech, since it’s such a challenging and multifaceted competition. I also learned that wet lab work wasn’t really for me, haha. That was an important insight that helped me find my direction; today, I work at AnyoLabs, developing and applying AI models to discover new drugs. \n \n So if you’re interested in iGEM, I wholeheartedly recommend it.

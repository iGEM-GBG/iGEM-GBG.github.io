ALUMNI YEAR: 2018
ALUMNI STORY: I was part of the Chalmers-Gothenburg iGEM team in 2018, during the last year of my master’s, and it was a great experience!  I got to collaborate on an open scientific problem together with people who were also keen on making the project work. We had a lot of fun, both working on the project and when taking part in several of the travelling opportunities that showed up in connection to iGEM. \n \n An iGEM project includes many different components, and it is possible to adapt each team members engagement to their interests. I, for example, spent a large part of the time on developing mathematical models, as this was where my interests lie. Of course, it is a team effort, and everyone needs to ensure that all components of the project move forward (but this only contributes to the fun!). \n \n While I did study Biotechnology at Chalmers, after my master’s in Complex Adaptive Systems, I went on to a PhD at Linköping University, focusing purely on statistics and machine learning. Today, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Medicine, University of Gothenburg, applying statistical analysis and machine learning to cardiometabolic disease. I’m really happy where I’m currently at, combining what I learned during my PhD with my background in biotechnology. Did being part of iGEM help me get here? I cannot say for sure. What I can say is that it was a great opportunity for working on a cool project together with amazing people!

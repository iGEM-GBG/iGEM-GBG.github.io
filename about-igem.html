                    <p>
                        iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) is the biggest international competition 
                        for synthetic biology in the world for students. The competition brings together multidisciplinary 
                        teams from universities around the world to tackle real-world problems using synthetic biology.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What does it mean to be part of the Chalmers-Gothenburg iGEM team?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The iGEM Gothenburg Chalmers team consists of dedicated bachelors- and master's students, 
                        who work together to develop a new product or process in the field of synthetic biology. 
                        The project includes planning, teambuilding, laboratory work, modeling, and outreach activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project offers students a deeper understanding of research, problem-solving, and synthetic 
                        biology. It also provides dedicated students with the opportunity to use their gained knowledge 
                        from their studies and find joy in contributing to something that can make a real difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The team is selected in January. During spring, the team decides on a project and formulates 
                        a detailed plan. Over the summer, the team works full-time on the project, conducting experiments, 
                        building models, and engaging in outreach activities. The project culminates in the Giant Jamboree 
                        in Paris, where teams present their work and compete for awards.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Who can join the iGEM Gothenburg team?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Anyone with an interest in synthetic biology and teamwork can join the iGEM Gothenburg team! 
                        We welcome individuals from diverse backgrounds, as the competition requires a multidisciplinary 
                        approach. Whether you're studying biology, chemistry, engineering, computer science, business, 
                        or any other field, there's a place for you on the team.

                                Team members specializing in graphics and web design are responsible for creating and maintaining 
                                the project website (Wiki). Their role involves designing visual content, creating graphics that 
                                explain the project, and ensuring the website effectively communicates the team's work. Collaboration 
                                with outreach and education team members is also crucial to produce graphics that effectively 
                                convey the project to companies and the public in an engaging way.

                                A key part of the iGEM project is spreading awareness about synthetic biology. This involves 
                                engaging with the public to share information about the project. Activities can include giving 
                                lectures, participating in local science fairs, or hosting synthetic biology workshops. The 
                                outreach team also works to educate the community about the potential and importance of synthetic biology.

                                To ensure the team can attend the Giant Jamboree at the end of the project to present your hard work, 
                                securing sponsorships is essential. Team members working on sponsorships reach out to companies, 
                                organizations, and foundations to secure funding for the project. This role involves communication, 
                                proposal writing, and relationship building with potential sponsors.

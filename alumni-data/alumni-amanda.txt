ALUMNI STORY: Participating in iGEM was an eye-opening experience. It brought lecture concepts to life, especially through endless PCRs (if you know, you know..), and taught me the value of creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving. Even now, as a postdoc, the spirit of iGEM continues to influence how I approach science: with curiosity, innovation, and teamwork.
